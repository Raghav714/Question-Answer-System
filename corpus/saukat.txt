Shaukat Ali had taken birth in 1873 in Rampur state which is now famous city of Uttar Pradesh. He had completed his education from Aligarh Muslim University. Shaukat Ali served in the civil service of the United Provinces of Oudh and Agra from 1896 to 1913 for 17 years in British India. Maulana, "Shaukat Ali", his brother "Mohammad Ali" and their mother "Bi Amman", has played an incredible role in the freedom movement of India against the British Imperialism. These brave freedom fighters were unmitigated champions of Hindu-Muslim unity who endorsed the Hindus and the Muslims to fight together in the struggle for independence from the British forgetting their religious feelings and thinking only they are Indians, they were the ambassadors of Hindu-Muslim Unity. They were arrested and imprisoned from 1921 to 1923 for his support to Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress during the Non-Cooperation Movement.
